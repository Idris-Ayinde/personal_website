        <p style="color: azure;">
            Hi! My name is Idris. I am currently in my third year of studying computer science at Ryerson University, as well as a student accepted in the co-op program.
            I'm eager and interested in learning about different sections of the computer science industry, I find cyber-security and data analytics really interesting. 
            I have learned Python and other programming language through lectures and online videos. I'm looking to expand my skill sets and apply knowledge to new and exciting projects. 
            I'm currently working on building my own personal webpage using HTML.</p>
